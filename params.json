{"name":"Zhuowei Cai","tagline":"Contact: iamcaizhuowei [at] gmail [dot] com","body":"### Biography\r\nI'm now a visiting student at the [Multimedia Lab](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), [Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Integrated Technology](http://english.siat.cas.cn/rh/rd/ioait/int/) (SIAT), which is cooperated by [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.cas.cn/) and the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/). I worked closely with [Limin Wang](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/personal/lmwang) and [Xiaojiang Peng](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/personal/pxj), under the supervision of [Prof. Yu Qiao](http://www.gavo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~qiao). Before coming to Shenzhen, I received my B.S. degree, from the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/en), [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english), supervised by [Prof. Jianlan Wu](http://physics.zju.edu.cn/pw/icmp/chinese/teacher/teachers/jlwu/people.html) and Dr. Zaixing Yang.\r\n\r\n### Research Interests\r\nMy interest is very broad, but particularly in optimization, statistics and machine learning theory. I have long maintained a strong interest toward these cool fields, intrigued by their intuitiveness and practicality. I also actively engaged in the application of statistical theory in fields like computer vision and computational biology, which inspires my truly understanding on the power of theory.  </p>\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n**Molecular Mechanism of the Early Stage of Amyloidogenic Hexapeptides Aggregation**\r\n<br>SHI Bi-Yun, ZHOU Bo, CAI Zhuo-Wei, XIU Peng, YANG Zai-Xing</br>\r\n<br>to appear in **COMMUNICATION IN THEORECTICAL PHYSICS**</br>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
